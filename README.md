# NLP-with-transformers

This repository is used to show the algorithms from the book **Natural Language Processing with Transformers**, these algorithms were presented in the classroom of the Database Topics III class of the Department of Informatics at PUC-Rio presented by the teachers Marco A. Casanova and Antonio L. Furtado.

## What is?

This is an adapted version of the algorithms presented in book Natural Language Processing with Transformers by the authors Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra & Thomas Wolf. 

To learn more about the content, consider using the book with the authors own annotations.
